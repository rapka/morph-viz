This is a React-based music visualizer. It was used for creating many of the music videos on the [College Hill Youtube channel](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLo3CZgeQIw_qrPqTIYZDeX2gyGVEwv8GB).

A similar version of this visualizer made specifically for the 2019 College Hill album Overground Underground is available [here](https://github.com/rapka/over-under).

## Setup

```
nvm use
npm ci
npm start
```

Once running, your browser should automatically open to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Use the spacebar to being playback. There's currently no support for pausing and replaying a song requires a page refresh.
